# Spending Frustration

Spending Frustration is an experimental personal finance categorization monolith. It lets a user:

1. Register & authenticate (JWT based)
2. Store & retrieve transactions
3. Define rules composed of conditions + actions (future: apply them automatically)
4. (Planned) Upload bank / card statement CSV files for ingestion

Technologies: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB, React (TypeScript ‚Äì scaffold stage).

## High-Level Goals
- Keep architecture intentionally simple (no service layer yet)
- Expose raw Mongo `_id` in responses for transparency
- Make rule system extensible for later enrichment & automation
- Provide clear, AI-friendly documentation for future iteration

## Repository Layout
| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `backend/` | FastAPI backend application |
| `frontend/` | React frontend scaffold |
| `docs/` | In-depth technical documentation |

## Getting Started (Backend Quickstart)
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir backend --reload
```

Set `MONGO_URI` and (optional) `MONGO_DB` env vars. Replace `SECRET_KEY` in `backend/app/auth.py` before any non-local use.

## Documentation
Detailed docs live in the `docs/` folder:
- API surface: `docs/api-endpoints.md`
- Database models: `docs/database-models.md`
- Architecture decisions: `docs/architecture.md`
- Glossary: `docs/glossary.md`
- AI context guide: `docs/ai-prompt-notes.md`

## Roadmap (Short-Term)
- Rule execution engine to auto-categorize
- Indexing & performance tuning
- Frontend UI build-out
- Rule application audit trail
