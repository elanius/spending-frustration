# Spending Frustration

Spending Frustration is an experimental personal finance categorization monolith. It lets a user:

1. Register & authenticate (JWT based)
2. Store & retrieve transactions
3. Define rules composed of conditions + actions (future: apply them automatically)
4. (Planned) Upload bank / card statement CSV files for ingestion

Technologies: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB, React (TypeScript ‚Äì scaffold stage).

## High-Level Goals
- Keep architecture intentionally simple (no service layer yet)
- Expose raw Mongo `_id` in responses for transparency
- Make rule system extensible for later enrichment & automation
- Provide clear, AI-friendly documentation for future iteration

## Repository Layout
| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `backend/` | FastAPI backend application |
| `frontend/` | React frontend scaffold |
| `docs/` | In-depth technical documentation |

## Getting Started (Backend Quickstart)
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir backend --reload
```

Set `MONGO_URI` and (optional) `MONGO_DB` env vars. Replace `SECRET_KEY` in `backend/app/auth.py` before any non-local use.

## Documentation
Detailed docs live in the `docs/` folder:
- API surface: `docs/api-endpoints.md`
- Database models: `docs/database-models.md`
- Architecture decisions: `docs/architecture.md`
- Glossary: `docs/glossary.md`
- AI context guide: `docs/ai-prompt-notes.md`

## Roadmap (Short-Term)
- Rule execution engine to auto-categorize
- Indexing & performance tuning
- Frontend UI build-out
- Rule application audit trail

## Frontend (Refactor Overview)
The React (Vite + TypeScript) frontend now includes minimal, focused components:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `NavBar` | Simple in-memory navigation between feature views (no router yet) |
| `Transactions` | Lists transactions with basic filtering (merchant/category/tags/amount). Can optionally hit server filter endpoint. |
| `RulesManager` | CRUD interface for textual rules (each rule is a single string; name + active flag) |
| `api.ts` | Tiny fetch helper that injects `Authorization: Bearer <token>` if `localStorage.authToken` exists |

Run it:
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Optionally create `frontend/.env` with `VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000`.

### Authentication Flow (Frontend)
1. Start the backend (see quickstart above).
2. Visit the frontend dev server (default: http://localhost:5173).
3. You'll see a login/register card. First-time: switch to Register, enter username + password (email optional), submit.
4. On success, switch to Login automatically; enter credentials and login. A JWT is stored in `localStorage.authToken`.
5. After login, the app shows navigation (Transactions / Rules). All API calls now include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
6. Use the Logout button (top-right) to clear the token and return to the auth screen.

The token is not auto-refreshed; for now you may need to re-login after expiry (24h default). Replace the hard-coded `SECRET_KEY` in `backend/app/auth.py` before any multi-user scenario.

### Rule Creation Notes
- New textual rules are appended at the end of your rule list automatically (priority = current count).
- You can optionally supply a `priority` integer in the POST body to insert at a specific index.
- Backend accepts omission of `priority` and will compute the next index.

Rules are currently stored as plain text lines (see `UserRules` and `RuleDB` models) and parsed server-side. The UI edits the raw rule string; advanced structured editing is postponed.

Planned UI enhancements (not yet implemented): pagination, routing (React Router), optimistic updates, validation & toast notifications, multi-condition visual builder.
